        <h2>Dear Hiring Manager,</h2>
        <p>
          I am writing to express my strong interest in the Intern position at
          Holoplot GmbH. As a Bachelor's student in Berlin with few months but
          worthwhile experience in Computer Science and IT, I believe my skills
          and qualifications make me an ideal fit for this role.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
          In my previous roles at AgileWow PVT LTD, I was responsible for
          managing to facilitate communication among appropriate parties. Being
          a Summer intern, I did take some coding projects but mostly things
          were non-technical. I am confident that my willingness to learn and
          provide will be beneficial for the company. Specially for the people I
          will work with.

        <h2>Passion for IT and Product Management</h2>
        <p>
          My love for IT and Product Management has been increasing since the
          past few years and I am getting to learn more about it through my dad
          and his real life experiences. I have been practicing by myself but
          now I would like pursue my skills in a professional environment. I was
          always keen to be in the IT sector but not just one field which gave
          me the window to try out new things at a young age, which states one
          of my beliefs that you can grow when you are open to learn new things
          and provide others the opportunity to do the same.

        <h2>Why Holoplot GmbH?</h2>
        <p>
          My main priority of taking a job is learn and grow, which applies to
          both me and the company. Holoplot GmbH caught my eye through their
          description being candid about how there is an opportunity to learn
          new things, which is what I am looking for right now.
